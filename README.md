Note:
This app was created by me while following the exercises of first chapter of Book (Fullstack React: The Complete Guide to ReactJS and Friends).
I'm reading this book to get an indepth understanding of ReactJs Concepts.
During the First chapter,  I covered some fundamental concepts including:
1. React app made up Components
2. Used JSX inside render() method
3. Data flows from parent to children through props
4. Event flows from children to parent through functions
5. Utilized some React lifecycle methods
6. Stateful components and how state is different from props
7. How to manipulate state while treaating it as immutable
8. Babel plugins like property initializer
